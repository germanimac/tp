            Long before the First Age, Sauron was originally the mightiest Maia of the Vala Aulë the Smith; his name then was Mairon, meaning "the admirable". 
            He learned much from Aulë in the ways of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman, and "mighty in the lore of" Aulë's people. He was 
            among the most powerful Maiar - if not the most powerful. During this time, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and incorrupt. His greatest virtue
            was his love of order and perfection - dislike of anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of his downfall, for, in the Dark
            Lord Morgoth, Mairon saw the will and power that would help him achieve his own goals and desires faster than if he pursued them alone. However, while
            Morgoth wanted to either control or destroy Arda itself, Mairon's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures. After Morgoth's defeat, 
            Sauron forsook his allegiance to both him and the Valar, desiring to establish his own dominion and impose order through control by force. Nonetheless, 
            he would later encourage and coerce Númenóreans to worship Morgoth (only because at that time he could not propound himself as a god) and presented himself 
            to the Elves as an outright servant of the Valar. In truth, Sauron did not seek to serve, only to master those around him for his own plots (which would prove 
            useful in understanding the mind of Saruman). After allying himself with Morgoth, Mairon maintained his appearance of being faithful to the Valar, but secretly 
            fed Morgoth information about their dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his strongholds in Middle-earth that Sauron left Valinor and openly declared 
            his allegiance, thence remaining a recognized foe of the Valar and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. The Sindar Elves in Beleriand called him Gorthaur, meaning 
            "dread abomination", and by others of the Eldar he was named Sauron, meaning "the abhorred" or "the abominable" (a mockery of his original name).

            "In my story Sauron represents as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is possible. He had gone the way of all tyrants: beginning well, at least on the level
            that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of the Earth. But 
            he went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for domination, being in origin an immortal (angelic) spirit. Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held 
            to be this by his servants, by a triple treachery: 1. Because of his admiration of Strength he had become a follower of Morgoth and fell with him down into the depths 
            of evil, becoming his chief agent in Middle-earth. 2. when Morgoth was defeated by the Valar finally he forsook his allegiance; but out of fear only; he did not present 
            himself to the Valar or sue for pardon, and remained in Middle-earth. 3. When he found how greatly his knowledge was admired by all other rational creatures and how easy 
            it was to influence them, his pride became boundless."  — J.R.R. Tolkien
